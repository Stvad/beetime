# Description
This add-on connects Anki to your Beeminder graphs.  Currently it supports syncing your time spent reviewing, number of cards reviewed and/or number of cards/notes added, with more metrics planned.  Discussion of features and bugs takes place over [on this thread on the Beeminder forum](http://forum.beeminder.com/t/announcing-beeminder-for-anki/2206).  The published version of this add-on can be found over on [AnkiWeb](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1728790823)

# Contributing
Thanks!

Just two suggestions regarding commits: use a verb in the active tense and add a context cue to the front of the commit message.

# Notes
Edit the .ui file in Qt Creator and build it using `pyuic4`. `make ui` should take care of that.
